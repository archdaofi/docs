## Creating a Proposal

Proposals are the primary mechanism through which decisions are made on ArchDAO. They define specific actions that affect a project’s direction, treasury, or token economics.

Anyone may create a proposal for a project.

---

### What Proposals Can Do

Proposals may be used to:

- Spend USDC from the project treasury
- Issue new tokens
- Update token metadata
- Increase or decrease liquidity provided by the project’s treasury

Each proposal must define a clear and discrete action that can be evaluated by the market.

---

### Going Live

Once a proposal is created, it does not immediately become active.

To go live, token holders must stake tokens in support of the proposal. By default, a proposal requires **50,000,000 tokens** to be staked before it becomes active.

Staking exists solely to prevent spam and low-quality proposals. Staked tokens are not locked and are not subject to slashing.

Only one proposal may be live at any given time.
