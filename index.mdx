## Introduction

### The Problem with Today’s Token Model

The most important key performance indicator (KPI) for investors, traders, and token holders is the price of an asset and its direction over time.

In most crypto projects, however, these market participants have little to no ability to influence the future value of a token beyond choosing whether or not to sell it. Ownership alone does not provide meaningful participation in the decisions that shape long-term value.

This dynamic has led to several common outcomes:

- Extremely short average token holding periods
- Highly rotational market behavior

These outcomes are not surprising. When investors lack mechanisms to influence value creation after the initial attention cycle fades, there is little incentive to continue holding the token.

    proposal governance.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Overview

Proposals may be created by anyone and can do the following:

- Move treasury funds
- Mint tokens
- Increase/decrease LP allocation
- Update token metadata

For each proposal:

- A **binary decision** is defined, such as `YES / NO` or `PASS / FAIL`
- Each outcome is **tokenized** into a tradeable derivative of the project’s token
- Each outcome is priced based on the question: **“What would the value of the token be if this proposal were to pass?”**
- Participants can **buy or sell** either side of the decision
- Projects / Organizations accept the outcome that results in the highest future price of the token

Investors and other stake holders participate in project governance by trading **decision markets tied to specific proposals**.
