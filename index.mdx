ArchDAO enables governance through markets—where conviction is measured by capital at risk:

  Decisions belong to those who stake conviction.

## Introduction

### The Problem with Today’s Token Model

The most important key performance indicator (KPI) for investors, traders, and token holders is the price of an asset and its direction over time.

In most crypto projects, however, these market participants have little to no ability to influence the future value of a token beyond choosing whether or not to sell it. Ownership alone does not provide meaningful participation in the decisions that shape long-term value.

This dynamic has led to several common outcomes:

- Extremely short average token holding periods
- Highly rotational market behavior

These outcomes are not surprising. When investors lack mechanisms to influence value creation after the initial attention cycle fades, there is little incentive to continue holding the token.

### ArchDAO

ArchDAO is a platform that provides founders with

1. Allows founders to:

2. Allows token holders, investors, and traders to participate directly in governance over:

- Founder decisions
- Project direction
- Treasury usage and capital expenditures

This participation occurs through **prediction markets tied to specific proposals**.

For each proposal:

- A **binary decision** is defined, such as `YES / NO` or `PASS / FAIL`
- Each outcome is **tokenized** into a tradeable derivative of the project’s token
- Each outcome is priced based on the question: **“What would the future value of the token be if this proposal were to pass or fail?”**
- Participants can **buy or sell** either side of the decision
- Projects / Organizations accept the outcome that results in the highest anticipated future price of the token

### Opinions Don’t Create Value—Correct Decisions Do

Not every opinion is right.  
Not every idea is good.

Traditional governance asks token holders _what they think should happen_.  
ArchDAO asks a more important question:

<Callout type="warning">
  What are you willing to risk capital on creating value?
</Callout>

Influence in ArchDAO is earned by staking conviction.  
Being wrong has a cost. Being right has a reward.

Governance becomes a function of accuracy, not consensus.

### How Decisions Are Priced

The price of each binary represents the market’s **anticipated future value of the project’s token**, conditional on that outcome occurring.

For example:

- If the market believes the token will be worth more _if a proposal fails_:
  - Traders can **buy the FAIL market**
  - And/or **sell the PASS market**

<Note>
  Binary prices are not opinions—they are forecasts backed by capital.
</Note>

The outcome with the strongest market signal becomes the decision.

### Why This Matters

For investors and traders, the most important KPI is price—and anticipated future price.

In traditional markets:

- You can trade on outcomes
- But you cannot influence the decisions that create them

ArchDAO changes this.

Governance itself becomes a market.  
Stakeholders can now directly participate in shaping the decisions that determine value.

  ArchDAO turns governance from politics into price.
