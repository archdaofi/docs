## Overview

Launching a project on ArchDAO is not just about raising capital. It is about presenting your project in a way that allows investors to accurately evaluate future value.

Strong launches are characterized by clear information, visible progress, and credible signals. The more effectively you reduce uncertainty for investors, the more likely your raise is to succeed.

## Product Readiness

### Working Product

While it is possible to launch a raise at earlier stages, having a completed and functional product is strongly recommended.

A working product provides investors with tangible evidence of execution capability and reduces reliance on speculation. Projects with a live application, demo, or usable feature set consistently attract more informed participation.

### Finding Product Market Fit

Signals of product market fit significantly improve investor confidence. These may include an active user base, early adoption, repeat usage, or organic growth.

Demonstrating that users find value in your product helps investors better assess how future decisions may impact long-term token value.

### Why Product Maturity Matters

Investors participating in ArchDAO governance evaluate proposals based on anticipated future value. Product maturity lowers uncertainty around execution risk and allows decision markets to price outcomes more accurately.

The more concrete your progress, the stronger the signal to participants evaluating your raise.

## Build in Public

### Community Matters

Transparent and open communication builds trust between founders and investors.

Every project is expected to maintain a public space where users and investors can discuss the product, its use cases, and its future direction. Recommended platforms include Twitter communities and either a Discord server or Telegram group.

Active discussion, clear responses, and visible founder participation all contribute to stronger investor confidence.

### Active Social Accounts

Projects should maintain active social accounts that are at least one week old and contain relevant content related to the product.

Consistent posting and ongoing updates signal accountability and momentum. Social channels should reflect real progress, development updates, and forward-looking plans.

Due to the governance structure of ArchDAO raises, prolonged founder inactivity may negatively impact investor confidence. In extreme cases, sustained inactivity can result in the investor community voting to refund the raise.

## Optimizing for Investor Evaluation

### Information Availability

Investors rely on available information to evaluate proposals and price decision markets. Clear documentation, visible progress, and accessible communication improve the accuracy of market pricing.

The quality of information you provide directly affects how your project is evaluated.

### Reducing Uncertainty

Reducing uncertainty is one of the most effective ways to increase participation. Product readiness, public communication, and consistent updates all help investors better assess risk and future value.

Lower uncertainty leads to stronger engagement and healthier markets.

### Increasing Raise Success

Successful raises are not driven by attention alone. They are driven by trust, transparency, and credible signals.

By preparing thoroughly and building in public, founders increase participation, improve alignment with investors, and set the foundation for long-term governance and growth on ArchDAO.
