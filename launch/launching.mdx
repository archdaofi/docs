## Launching Your Project

To launch your project and initiate an ICO raise on ArchDAO, founders are required to provide the following information. These requirements exist to ensure investors have sufficient clarity to evaluate the project, its structure, and its potential upside.

Clear, complete, and accurate disclosures significantly improve investor confidence and increase the likelihood of a successful raise.

### Project Requirements

- **Project name and description**  
  The name of the project and a clear explanation of what it does and why investors should care about its upside. Two versions of the description are required:

  - A short one to two sentence pitch
  - A longer, more detailed description that explains the product, its use cases, and long-term vision

- **Token name and ticker**  
  The name and ticker symbol of the project’s token, for example "\$ARCH" and “\$AERO.” Founders are encouraged to use memorable and unique tickers to avoid confusion across trading venues.

- **Project image and token image**  
  Visual assets used to represent the project on ArchDAO and external trading platforms such as Jupiter. If the project image and token image differ, both must be provided.

- **Minimum raise amount**  
  The minimum amount of capital required for the project to proceed with this fundraising path. If the raise does not meet this threshold, all funds are refunded to participants. Founders are encouraged to include a buffer for unexpected expenses as well as the required liquidity provision.

- **Monthly team budget**  
  The amount of capital the team requires each month from the treasury to operate under normal conditions. Expenditures exceeding this amount must be approved through governance. This value may be updated later through governance but cannot exceed one sixth of the minimum raise amount.

- **Performance package configuration**  
  Following the ICO, 700 million tokens are allocated to sale participants and 300 million tokens are allocated to liquidity. Founders may optionally pre-allocate up to 1 billion additional tokens to a performance package, increasing the total supply to 2 billion tokens.

  The performance package is divided into five equal tranches that unlock at the following price multiples relative to the ICO price:

  - 2x
  - 4x
  - 8x
  - 16x
  - 32x

  The earliest unlock period must be at least 18 months from the ICO date, though founders may choose a longer minimum duration. Unlock eligibility is determined using a three month time weighted average price, meaning the price threshold must be achieved and sustained for the full TWAP period.

  **Example:**  
  A founder pre-allocates 1 billion tokens to a performance package with a minimum unlock time of 24 months. The project raises \$1,000,000, resulting in an ICO price of \$0.001 per token. After 24 months, the token trades at \$0.01, representing a 10x increase. The founder initiates the TWAP, and the price remains at this level for three months. At that point, the first three tranches unlock, totaling 600 million tokens. One year later, the token trades at \$0.02, allowing an additional tranche of 200 million tokens to unlock.

- **Intellectual property assignment**  
  A list of intellectual property that the founder or founding team agrees to assign to the project’s entity. This may include domain names, software, repositories, and social media accounts. These assets are owned by the project’s governance DAO and controlled by its key stakeholders.
