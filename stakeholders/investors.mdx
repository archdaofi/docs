## Overview

For token investors, the core problem is simple: most tokens expose holders to downside risk without giving them meaningful control over outcomes.

ArchDAO is designed to change that. It gives investors direct influence over how capital is used, how decisions are made, and how projects respond when things go wrong.

---

## The Core Investor Problem

### Lack of Control

In most token launches, investors provide capital but have little to no ability to influence how that capital is used. Treasury decisions are often made unilaterally, and governance mechanisms, when they exist, are weak or ineffective.

Ownership does not translate into control.

### Asymmetric Risk

Token holders typically absorb the majority of downside risk while founders and insiders retain decision-making power. When decisions fail or incentives break down, investors have few tools to protect their capital.

### Repeated Failure Modes

The crypto ecosystem has repeatedly demonstrated the same failure patterns: misused treasuries, abandoned projects, and value extraction with no recourse for token holders.

These outcomes are not edge cases. They are structural failures of existing models.

---

## Capital Protection Through Governance

### Market-Governed Treasuries

On ArchDAO, capital raised during a launch is placed into a treasury governed by token holders rather than controlled solely by founders.

This ensures that major capital movements are subject to governance rather than trust.

### Decision Markets as Enforcement

Treasury usage and major actions must pass through proposals and decision markets. This creates a real constraint on harmful behavior, as poor decisions are punished through price and governance outcomes.

### Capital Return Mechanisms

If a project stalls, underperforms, or behaves maliciously, investors can propose actions to return capital to token holders or otherwise protect remaining value.

This creates a credible path to downside protection that does not exist in most token models.

## Reducing Governance Risk

### Governance With Consequences

In ArchDAO, governance participation requires risk. Investors who are wrong lose capital, while those who are correct are rewarded.

This discourages low-effort or speculative participation and improves decision quality over time.

### Price as the Primary Signal

Investors already care about price and future price expectations. ArchDAO aligns governance with this reality by allowing participants to express beliefs directly through markets rather than abstract votes.

### Continuous Participation

Unlike one-time votes, decision markets allow investors to respond to new information as it emerges. Governance becomes an ongoing process rather than a static event.

---

## Alignment and Transparency

### Founder Accountability

Founders retain the ability to propose actions, but they are bound by market outcomes. Decisions that reduce expected value are unlikely to pass, regardless of who proposes them.

### Transparent Execution

All proposals, trades, and treasury movements are executed transparently. Investors can verify how decisions are made and how capital is used without relying on off-chain assurances.

### Aligned Incentives

Investors, founders, and traders are all exposed to the same economic outcomes. This alignment reduces adversarial dynamics and focuses participation on value creation.

## Who ArchDAO Is For

### Ideal Investor Profile

ArchDAO is well suited for investors who:

- Care about long-term value creation
- Want influence over governance outcomes
- Are willing to actively participate in decision markets
- Prefer transparency over trust-based systems

### When ArchDAO May Not Be a Fit

ArchDAO may not be appropriate for investors who:

- Prefer purely passive exposure
- Are seeking short-term speculative trades
- Do not wish to engage with governance mechanisms
- Are uncomfortable with market-driven decision making
