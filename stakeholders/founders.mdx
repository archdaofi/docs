## Overview

ArchDAO is built for founders who want to raise capital, launch a token, and govern a project in a way that aligns long-term incentives.

If you are building a crypto-native product and need capital, there are several paths available today. Most of them optimize for speed, hype, or short-term extraction rather than durable value creation. ArchDAO exists as an alternative to those paths.

This page is written to help founders understand when ArchDAO is the right choice and what trade-offs come with it.

## Introduction

Launching a token is one of the most consequential decisions a founder can make. It determines not only how capital is raised, but also how decisions are made and who ultimately holds influence over the project.

ArchDAO can be thought of as a system for founders who want to raise capital without giving up control to opaque intermediaries, while still being accountable to the stakeholders most exposed to outcomes.

## The Existing Paths and Their Trade-Offs

### The Standard Token Launch Path

The most common path today involves raising capital from venture investors, delaying token issuance, and eventually launching through a highly structured and marketing-driven event.

This model is optimized for short-term liquidity events rather than long-term business health. It often results in misaligned incentives, low float tokens, and governance structures that exist largely in name only.

### Never Launching a Token

Some teams choose to avoid tokens entirely and build a traditional company funded through equity.

This approach can be reasonable, especially if investors do not expect a token or if the product does not benefit from token-based coordination. However, it sacrifices many of the advantages of crypto-native ownership and open participation.

### Bonding Curves and Creator Fee Platforms

Platforms built around bonding curves or creator fees make it easy to launch a token quickly, but they rarely provide meaningful capital or long-term alignment.

These launches tend to attract short-term traders rather than committed stakeholders and often leave founders without the resources needed to build a serious product.

### Traditional ICOs

Traditional ICOs give founders discretion over raised capital, but they rely heavily on trust. Due to historical abuse, many serious investors are skeptical of this model, making it difficult to attract long-term holders without significant reputation or legal overhead.

## Why ArchDAO Is Different

### Capital Without Over-Raising

ArchDAO allows founders to raise capital based on actual project needs rather than market hype. Discretionary caps make it possible to accept strong demand without committing to unnecessary dilution or excess capital.

### Governance With Accountability

Founders retain the ability to propose actions, but outcomes are determined by markets. Decision markets constrain poor decisions while preserving founder leadership and execution authority.

### Aligned Long-Term Holders

Because governance participation requires risk, ArchDAO attracts stakeholders who care about outcomes. This results in a holder base that is aligned with long-term value creation rather than short-term speculation.

### Transparent Execution

All governance actions, treasury movements, and outcomes are executed transparently. This reduces trust assumptions and creates credibility with investors from day one.

## Trade-Offs and Responsibilities

### Public Markets Are Honest

Launching on ArchDAO means operating in a public market environment. Token prices move in response to decisions, performance, and sentiment. This transparency can be uncomfortable, but it is also honest feedback.

### Founder Participation Matters

Founders are expected to communicate, propose decisions, and remain engaged. Inactivity or poor communication can directly impact investor confidence and governance outcomes.

### Governance Is Binding

Governance on ArchDAO is not advisory. Market outcomes determine decisions, and founders are expected to respect and execute those outcomes.

## Who ArchDAO Is For

### Ideal Founder Profile

ArchDAO works best for founders who:

- Are building crypto-native products
- Value transparency and accountability
- Want aligned, long-term stakeholders
- Are comfortable operating in public markets

### When Not to Use ArchDAO

ArchDAO may not be the right choice if you:

- Do not plan to launch a token
- Want unilateral control over treasury and decisions
